# 05-roman-numbers

## Task

Write a program that converts a Roman numeral to an integer and vice versa.

Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit individually, starting with the leftmost digit and omitting
any digit with a value of zero. 1990 is denoted by Roman numerals: 1000=M, 900=CM, 90=XC; as a result of MCMXC. 2008 is
written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII. 1666 uses each Roman character in descending order: MDCLXVI.

Input range: 1 <= n < 4000
4 should be represented as IV.
